The shared dependencies between the files we are generating are:

1. **Character**: This class is likely to be used in multiple files such as `ColorDashApplication.java`, `GameController.java`, and `GameView.java` to control the character's movements and interactions with the game elements.

2. **Path**: This class is likely to be used in `ColorDashApplication.java`, `GameController.java`, and `GameView.java` to generate and control the scrolling path.

3. **Obstacle**: This class is likely to be used in `ColorDashApplication.java`, `GameController.java`, and `GameView.java` to generate and control the obstacles on the path.

4. **Gem**: This class is likely to be used in `ColorDashApplication.java`, `GameController.java`, and `GameView.java` to generate and control the gems that the character can collect.

5. **PowerUp**: This class is likely to be used in `ColorDashApplication.java`, `GameController.java`, and `GameView.java` to generate and control the power-ups that the character can collect.

6. **Score**: This class is likely to be used in `ColorDashApplication.java`, `GameController.java`, and `GameView.java` to keep track of the player's score.

7. **GameController**: This class is likely to be used in `ColorDashApplication.java` and `GameView.java` to control the game's logic.

8. **GameView**: This class is likely to be used in `ColorDashApplication.java` and `GameController.java` to control the game's visuals.

9. **Application Properties**: This file is likely to be used in `ColorDashApplication.java` to configure the application's settings.

10. **POM.xml**: This file is likely to be used in `ColorDashApplication.java` to manage the project's dependencies.

11. **README.md**: This file is likely to be used in `ColorDashApplication.java` to provide information about the project.

The shared function names across these files could include `moveCharacter()`, `scrollPath()`, `generateObstacle()`, `collectGem()`, `activatePowerUp()`, `updateScore()`, `startGame()`, `pauseGame()`, `resumeGame()`, and `endGame()`.
